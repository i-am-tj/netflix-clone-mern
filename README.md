### Starting the API Server

To start the RESTful API server, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your Node.js project where the `app.js` or main server file is located:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/node/project
   ```

3. Run the following command to start the server: `npm start`

4. The server will be accessible at http://localhost:your-port in your web browser or through API client tools. Replace your-port with the port number you've configured in your project (e.g., 3000).
